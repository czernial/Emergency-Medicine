The patient will be discharged home. The patient was reassured that these symptoms do not appear to represent a serious or life threatening condition at this time. Warning signs of worsening condition were discusses and understood by the patient. Based on patient's age, coexisting illness, exam and the results of this ED evaluation, the decision to treat as an outpatient was made. Based on the information available at time of discharge, acute pathology requiring immediate intervention was deemed relative unlikely. While it is impossible to completely exclude the possibility of underlying serious disease or worsening condition, I feel the relative likelihood is extremely low. I discussed this uncertainty with the patient and/or family member/caregiver, who understood ED evaluation and treatment and felt comfortable with the outpatient treatment plan. All questions regarding care, test results and follow up were answered. At discharge, pt looked well, nontoxic, no distress, and is good candidate for outpatient follow up. They understand that they should return to the Emergency Department for any new or worsening symptoms. I stressed the importance of follow up for repeat assessment and possibly further evaluation/treatment.Â
